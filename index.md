## I

What I should like to propose in this article is not a new answer to the basically 
unanswerable question, 'what is climbing?', but rather a new way of talking and 
thinking about it. Climbing is not a homogeneous sport but rather a collection of 
differing (though) related activities, each with its own adepts, distinctive 
terrain, problems and satisfactions, and perhaps most important, its own rules. 
Therefore, I propose to consider climbing in general as a hierarchy of climbing-
games, each defined by a set of rules and an appropriate field of play.
