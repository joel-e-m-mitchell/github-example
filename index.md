## I

What I should like to propose in this article is not a new answer to the basically 
unanswerable question, 'what is climbing?', but rather a new way of talking and 
thinking about it. Climbing is not a homogeneous sport but rather a collection of 
differing (though) related activities, each with its own adepts, distinctive 
terrain, problems and satisfactions, and perhaps most important, its own rules. 
Therefore, I propose to consider climbing in general as a hierarchy of climbing-
games, each defined by a set of rules and an appropriate field of play.

The word game seems to imply a sort of artificiality which is foreign to what we 
actually feel on a climb. The attraction of the great walls, above all, is surely 
that when one is climbing them he is playing 'for keeps'. Unlike the player in a 
bridge game, the climber cannot simply lay down his cards and go home. But this 
does not mean that climbing is any less a game. Although the player's actions have 
real and lasting consequences, the decision to start playing is just as gratuitous 
and unnecessary as the decision to start a game of chess. In fact, it is precisely 
because there is no necessity to climb that we can describe climbing as a game 
activity.
